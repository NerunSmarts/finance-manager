# how to build:

**This assumes you have node.js installed, if not, please install it from https://nodejs.org/**

1. Starting inside the project directory (and using a CLI, not GUI!), navigate to `finance-manager/main`

2. Run `npm install` once you're in the correct diectory to install all dependencies from `package.json`   

3. Run `pip install twelvedata` in the same directory to install the required package for the `StockAPI.py`(unimplemented)

4. Run the command `npm run start` to start the program, if you wish to start it without building.    

5. If you wish to build, run `npm run make` to build the project, it should create a folder called `out` that contains your executable.
