# finance-manager
a light finance manager created as a group project for a software engineering course    
icons from ionicons (ionic.io/ionicons)    
also on gitlab! (for now)    

# how to build/run:

**This assumes you have node.js installed, if not, please install it from https://nodejs.org/**

1. Starting inside the project directory (and using a CLI, not GUI!), navigate to the last folder called `finance-manager`, it should contain a folder called `src`. (yes, we are aware that the folder structure is kind of broken. We'll fix it later, right now we're busy writing it still.)    

2. Run `npm install` once you're in the correct diectory to install all dependencies from `package.json`   

3. Run the command `npm run start` to start the program, if you wish to start it without building.    

4. If you wish to build, run `npm run make` to build the project, it should create a folder called `out` that contains your executable.
